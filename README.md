# Weather Now

**Status: Work in Progress**

A modern weather application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app provides real-time weather information for any location, displaying current conditions, hourly forecasts, and comprehensive weather metrics. This project was taken from Frontend Mentor's [Weather App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/weather-app-K1FhddVm49) exercise, which I developed and modified.

## Features

- Location-based weather search with autocomplete suggestions
- Real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
- Hourly forecast display with weather icons and temperature readings
- Dynamic weather icon selection based on weather codes
- Responsive design optimized for multiple screen sizes
- Global state management for weather data and location information

## Technology Stack

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- SCSS for styling
- Geolocation API for location-based services
- Open-Meteo API for weather data

## Project Structure

The application is organized with clear separation of concerns:
- Components for UI elements and views
- Services for API calls and data fetching
- Utilities for global state management and context
- Configuration files for weather codes and API endpoints

## Todos

1. Add Daily forecast
2. Change Units and it's values
2. Test UI in different screens
